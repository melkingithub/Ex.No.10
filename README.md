### Name: D.MELKIN SAM
### Reg.No: 212223220056

## Aim:
To demonstrate how different prompting techniques (decision-making prompts, comparative prompts, SWOT-based prompts, etc.) can be used to create business reports, feasibility studies, or case studies. The objective is to evaluate how structured prompting can improve analytical depth, factual accuracy, and professional tone in business-related content.

## Procedure:
### 1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns:

Begin by understanding how specific prompt patterns can be applied to business contexts:

Decision-Making Prompts: Asking the model to choose between alternative strategies, markets, or business models.

Comparative Prompts: Comparing two or more business scenarios, competitors, or performance metrics.

SWOT-Based Prompts: Using structured frameworks like Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to analyze a business situation.

Analytical Prompts: Guiding the model to provide data-driven insights and logical reasoning.

Fact Check List Prompts: Ensuring the generated business content is factual and verifiable.

Tail Generation Prompts: Extending the report with actionable recommendations and future outlooks.

Semantic Filtering Prompts: Adjusting tone and writing style for a formal, professional, or executive audience.

### 2. Choosing the Content Type:

Decide on the business-oriented content to create. Examples include:

Business Report (e.g., Market Trends Analysis, Feasibility Study)

Case Study (e.g., Startup Success Story, Corporate Strategy Analysis)

Comparative Report (e.g., Performance of Competing Firms)

SWOT Analysis Report (e.g., Product Launch Feasibility)

### 3. Creating the Prompts:

Start with simple, general prompts to generate an initial draft.

Gradually refine the prompts by including specific techniques such as:

Decision-Making Prompts: “Choose the best strategy for expanding into international markets.”

Comparative Prompts: “Compare Company A’s sustainability model with Company B’s.”

SWOT-Based Prompts: “Generate a SWOT analysis for launching a new e-commerce platform.”

Semantic Filtering: “Rewrite the report in a formal, boardroom-appropriate tone.”

### 4. Generating and Refining Outputs:

Initial Generation: Use simple prompts to get a basic report or case study draft.

Refinement Phase: Apply advanced prompt techniques to improve the structure, analysis, and professional tone.

Iteration: Modify prompts based on feedback—add more detail, specify tone, or request comparative evaluation.

### 5. Review and Evaluation:

Evaluate the generated outputs based on the following criteria:

Analytical Depth: Are insights data-driven and logically supported?

Professional Tone: Does the report sound formal and industry-appropriate?

Coherence: Is the report structured clearly with proper sections?

Accuracy: Are the facts and statistics plausible or verifiable?

Comparative Insight: Does the analysis offer valuable contrasts and recommendations?
